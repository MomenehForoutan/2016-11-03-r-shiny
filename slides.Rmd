## Presenting data on the web

Viewing a website requires:

* An HTTP client, such as Firefox or Chrome, which displays HTML documents and runs Javascript code. You the application writer don't have much control over the client, but it's reasonably well standardized.

* An HTTP server, running in the language of your choice with all your favourite libraries on the operating system of your choice.

So much effort has gone into writing great HTTP clients that display HTML that it now makes sense to write desktop applications this way as well! An "application" written in this style can run potentially run *anywhere*. Example: RStudio.


## Presenting data on the web

There is a spectrum of choices for where to put most of the cleverness and computation.

* Purely client-side -- The server merely serves static files. All the magic happens in Javascript, client-side.

* RESTful -- The server does the heavy lifting, such as accessing large databases, but doesn't keep track of sessions and state. Client-side Javascript still does quite a lot.

* Stateful server -- The server keeps track of sessions. It possibly runs a separate process per session.

The third option places a lot of load on the server, but is the most flexible.

Pure client can't work with large data, without heroic efforts (Dalliance).

## Shiny

The `shiny` library makes it easy to build stateful servers. When a user interacts with an "app" it's like using a graphical application written in R.

Other languages:

Python: bokeh

Lighter options:

`plotly` `htmlwidgets`



Shiny might not be your long-term solution, but it's probably your initial prototype.

Shiny (and R in genral) is great for people with just a little computing experience.

Example: Your favourite heatmap clustering algorithm in only available in R.



## Functional style

Reactive code should not have side-effects.

Do not

* modify globals with `<<-`

* mutate data structures <br>(fortunately, R code only uses mutation very rarely)

* plot within a reactive code block <br>(only plot by calling non-reactive code from within `renderPlot`)

* write to a file except, except within `downloadHandler`

unless you know exactly what you are doing, or weird bad things will happen.
